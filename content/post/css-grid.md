# CSS Grid Layout

The support of Grid layout is there in modern browsers.

* Flexbox is designed for layout in one dimension, either in a row or a column.
Grid is for two-dimensional layout, both rows and columns simultaneously.
* Flexbox works from content out. It means that the content first and layout adaptation later. 
Grid works from the layout in. Layout is created first.
