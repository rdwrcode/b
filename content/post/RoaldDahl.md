And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. 

This quote is from Roald Dahl's last children's story, The Minpins. In fact it is the very last line of that very last story.

Long long ago, I realized that magic works only once and you need figure out your own magic.
