Saw the following:
~~~css
12 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 67 + 8 + 9 = 100
~~~
Can you you come up with other ways?



Here are some solutions.

You've got 23 first, then
~~~css
1 + 23 - 4 + 56 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 100
~~~

You've got 67 first, then
~~~css
1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9 = 100
~~~

~~~css
12 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 67 + 8 + 9 = 100
~~~

You've got 78 first, then
~~~css
1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100
~~~

~~~css
-1 + 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100
~~~

You've got 123, then
~~~css
123 + 4 - 5 + 67 - 89 = 100
~~~

~~~css
123 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 8 - 9 = 100
~~~

~~~css
123 + 45 - 67 + 8 - 9 = 100
~~~

Then with ^
~~~css
12 + 3^4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9 = 100
~~~

Then with *
~~~css
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8*9 = 100
~~~

Then with decimal
~~~css
-1 + 2 + 98.3 + 6.4 - 5.7 = 100
~~~

~~~css
91 + 7.68 + 5.32 - 4 = 100
~~~
